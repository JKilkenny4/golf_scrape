# Scraping web for real-time golf scores
The Golf Channel app used to be great for seeing the scores of PGA, LPGA, DPWT, and some amateur golf scores. Unfortunately, it's being depracated in favor of the NBC Sports app.
The NBC Sports app accomplishes the same general task that the Golf Channel app did, but it's diluted with other sports and takes more time to navigate to the one sport that I care about. 
Ultimately I would like to build an app that sources real-time scores from all of the major golf events, but we'll see how far I get.
